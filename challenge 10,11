You will have to create the following hooks and use them all in one page:

useDeviceOrientation
useFavicon
useGeolocation
useKeyPress
useLocalStorage
useMousePosition
useOnline
useLockScroll
Here is the desired output:

useDeviceOrientation:
Takes no arguments, returns an object containing "alpha, beta, gamma".

useFavicon:
Takes the initial favicon URL as argument, returns 'setFavicon' that changes the favicon.

useGeolocation:
Take no arguments, returns an object containing 'error, coords: {lat:long}'

useKeyPress
Takes one argument, a key, returns a boolean that becomes 'true' or 'false' if the key is pressed

useLocalStorage
Takes two arguments, the name of the localStorage key, and the initialValue to give to it. Returns an array where the first item is the current element in localStorage and the second item is a function to update localStorage

useMousePosition:
Takes no arguments, returns the x,y coordinates of the mouse.

useOnline:
Takes no arguments, returns a boolean that changes when the user goes online or offline.

useLockScroll:
Takes no arguments, returns an array with two elements. The first element notifies 'true' or 'false' if the scroll is locked, the second element is an object containing two functions, one to lock scroll, one to unlock it.

조건:
Don't you dare give up!
